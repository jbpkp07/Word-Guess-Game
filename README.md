# Word-Guess-Game

This was written in vanilla Javascript, and html/CSS.

The game is played like the game "Hangman".

You can click the letter buttons, or press the keys on the keyboard.

Each time you get a word correct you get 100 points for each remaining guess.

If you guess it perfectly, you get a 1000 points added to your score.

If you aren't able to guess the word, you lose 1000 points.

Note the start sequence... It was made with love and care :-)
